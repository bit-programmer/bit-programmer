# Professional Bio 🚀

## Who Am I? 👨‍💻
Full-stack developer by day, batch processing wizard by night, and now diving headfirst into the AI/ML rabbit hole! 🤖 I love building things that work seamlessly and handle data like a boss.

## My Tech Arsenal 🛠️

**AI/ML Journey** 🤖🧠
- Teaching machines to think (or at least pretend to) 🎭
- Data science wizardry 📈
- Building smart web apps that get smarter every day 🌟

## The Plot Twist 🎬
Started building websites, fell in love with data processing, and now I'm teaching computers to be clever! 🎯 It's like being a translator between humans, machines, and now... artificial brains!

## What Gets Me Excited 🔥
